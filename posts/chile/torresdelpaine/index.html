Pack your bags and head down south to Torres del Paine National Park, also known as the Patagonia region. Absorb the breathtaking views and appreciate the wonders of this world.\nHow to arrive If you haven’t looked at a map, Torres del Paine is at the most southern end of Chile, so, depending on where you are coming from, you might have quite the journey ahead of you. First, I recommend flying to Santiago, Chile. Santiago is your connection point. From there, you will need to take a plane to Punta Arenas, Chile, which is the nearest airport to Torres del Paine. You can spend a day in Punta Arenas, but there is not much to see there. From Punta Arenas, you will need to take a bus to Puerto Natales. You can either leave directly from Punta Arenas airport or from the bus station in the city center. The bus takes between 2 and 3 hours.\nPuerto Natales is the town right under the national park. You may choose to stay a few days in this town. It is quite small, but also very cute. There are beautiful views of the mountains and cute shops. When you are ready to go to the national park, you will need to take a bus from Puerto Natales to Torres del Paine.\nThe coast of Puerto Natales Conquering the Patagonia TIP: My biggest recommendation is to plan your trip far in advance (at least a few months). There are limited spaces to stay in the park and you will need to plan accordingly.\nTIP: Also, check the weather! Chile has opposite seasons of the USA. If there is too much snow or danger risks, Torres del Paine will close their paths.\nTorres del Paine is a HUGE park. There are two main treks that you may consider. The “W” Trek or the “O” trek. Your decision will be based on the amount of time you have to visit the area and the amount of walking you want to do.\nThe “W” Trek What is wonderful about Torres del Paine is that all of the trails are clearly marked. If you stick to the trail, you will not get lost!\nFor those who only have a few days to spend in this region, I recommend the “W” Trek. It is called the “W” because it looks like a “W” on the map. Completing this trek will take you about 5 days. It is 45.4 miles (73.2 km). Along the way, there are lodging places to stop for the night.\nTIP: Plan out how much you will need to walk each day and how long it will take to get to your next lodging site.\nThe Highlights Here are the main highlights of the “W” trek.\nMirador Grey Mirador Grey Mirador Lago Skottsberg\nMirador Francés\nMirador Britanico\nMirador Base Torres\nBase Torres Salto Grande Salto Grande The “O” Trek When you add the “O” Trek to the “W” trek, are you now looking at 110 km. You can go in either direction because it is ultimately a circle. It usually takes between 8 and 10 days to complete. Be aware, this is a more challenging circuit. It includes long distances and uneven terrain. This trail will be less crowded, so expect to have some peace and quiet while you soak in the nature.\nTorres del Paine Mountains The Highlights Along with all of the “W” trek highlights you will also be able to see:\nMirador Juan Gardner\nMirador Valle de los Perros\nSerón\nLago Paine\nLago Dickson\nPaine Grande\nLos Cuernos\nThe Company Have you ever thought about traveling alone? While taking on the Patagonia sounds like a scary task, I 100% recommend this experience. It is a great way to self reflect and discover what you can do. Things that you thought would be impossible turn out to be possible!\nIf you are not up for the idea, I recommend traveling in small groups. This will be a very special experience and you should be able to enjoy every minute of it. There will be ups and downs, but it is all part of the journey!\nTorres del Paine
