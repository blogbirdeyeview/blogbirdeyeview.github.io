While in Spain, head down south to Gibraltar, a commonwealth of England. Gibraltar is 3 hours from Granada, 2 hours from Malaga, and about 7 hours from Madrid (all in car). I recommend taking a day trip while in Andalucía to see what the city is all about.\nGetting to Gibraltar While there are buses that will take you to Gibraltar from major Andalusian cities, I recommend renting a car for the day. It is a whole lot faster and more convenient. You can even make stops in several Andalusian cities along the way.\nI recommend parking the car before crossing the border. There is a parking lot very close to the border that costs about 2 euros per hour. Once you park, walk on over to the border control.\nAlert: BRING YOUR PASSPORT. You are leaving Spain and entering the United Kingdom. They will stamp your passport as you walk across.\nTake the bus right across the border to get to the center of the city and the cable car. It is cheaper to buy a round trip ticket if you know that you will want to take the bus back. Just don’t lose your ticket!\nTIP: In Gibraltar they use both euros and pounds. So, as long as you have one of the following you will be fine.\nTIP: Buses have discounts for seniors over 60 years old. Be sure to ask for that.\nWhile Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom, and the official language is English, many people also speak Spanish. In fact, most bus drivers are Spanish speaking but will understand some English.\nA Day Across the Border In my opinion, you only need 1 day in Gilbratar. I do not recommend staying the night. I got there at 5 pm and left at 9 pm. That was enough time to do what I wanted to do. The city center itself is very small. There are restaurants and small shops to explore.\nGibraltar City Center The big attraction is the rock of Gibraltar. You cannot miss it. It is a huge rock that overlooks the city. There are several ways to make it to the top. You can take the cable car, a bus tour, or walk. The first option might put a dent in your wallet. The cable car is 19 pounds for an adult, 9 pounds for a child (5-11) and 17 pounds for a senior (65+). There are many things that the rock offers, like museums, monuments, a nature reserve, castles, WWII Tunnels, and bridges. But, if you were like me, you may be only interested in one thing - seeing the monkeys!\nIf you are interested in only seeing the monkeys, I recommend walking. It is free and not too high up. You don’t need to go all the way to the top of the rock. You will follow a path up hill. Along the way you can take plenty of rests and soak up the incredible scenery. There are maps on the path to guide you to what you want to see.\nDon’t monkey around Here are a few warnings when seeing the monkeys.\nFirst, it is important to know that the monkeys are not in cages, they are free. But, do not touch them. They do not want to be touched and might feel threatened. Posing Monkeys Next, do not feed them. They are given food by the workers so there is no need to give them anything else.\nAlso, keep your bags close and visible to you at all times. Sometimes the monkeys will open your bags, looking for food, and they might take some of your stuff, including wallets and passports. So, be careful.\nFinally, do not bring your dogs near the monkeys. They feel threatened by dogs and start to get in attack mode. Just enjoy the monkeys! Be sure to take lots of pictures.\nSleepy Monkey ","wordCount":"673","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://live.staticflickr.com/688/22929317943_b91b037855_b.jpg","datePublished":"2023-05-25T10:30:30+01:00","dateModified":"2023-05-25T10:30:30+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nicole"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/posts/uk/gibraltar/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Bird’s Eye View","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/assets/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Bird’s Eye View (Alt + H)">Bird’s Eye View</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/country/ title=Countries><span>Countries</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blogbirdeyeview.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search&nbsp;<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-search" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M11.742 10.344a6.5 6.5.0 10-1.397 1.398h-.001c.03.04.062.078.098.115l3.85 3.85a1 1 0 001.415-1.414l-3.85-3.85a1.007 1.007.0 00-.115-.1zM12 6.5a5.5 5.5.0 11-11 0 5.5 5.5.0 0111 0z"/></svg></span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Gibraltar, UK</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-05-25 10:30:30 +0100 +0100'>May 25, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Nicole</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://live.staticflickr.com/688/22929317943_b91b037855_b.jpg alt="View of Rock of Gibraltar from Ocean"><p>Rock of Gibraltar</p></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#gibraltar-uk aria-label="Gibraltar, UK">Gibraltar, UK</a></li><li><a href=#getting-to-gibraltar aria-label="Getting to Gibraltar">Getting to Gibraltar</a></li><li><a href=#a-day-across-the-border aria-label="A Day Across the Border">A Day Across the Border</a><ul><li><a href=#dont-monkey-around aria-label="Don’t monkey around">Don’t monkey around</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=gibraltar-uk>Gibraltar, UK<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gibraltar-uk>#</a></h1><div class=prego-barButton><div class="d-inline-block p-2"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-calendar-heart" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 .5a.5.5.0 00-1 0V1H2A2 2 0 000 3v11a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V3a2 2 0 00-2-2h-1V.5a.5.5.0 00-1 0V1H4V.5zM1 14V4h14v10a1 1 0 01-1 1H2a1 1 0 01-1-1zm7-6.507c1.664-1.711 5.825 1.283.0 5.132-5.825-3.85-1.664-6.843.0-5.132z"/></svg>Travel date <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentcolor" class="bi bi-arrow-right" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M1 8a.5.5.0 01.5-.5h11.793l-3.147-3.146a.5.5.0 01.708-.708l4 4a.5.5.0 010 .708l-4 4a.5.5.0 01-.708-.708L13.293 8.5H1.5A.5.5.0 011 8z"/></svg>May 2023</span></div><div class="d-inline-block p-2"><a class=prego-a href=/posts/uk/><button type=button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Check other cities in United Kingdom</button></a></div></div><p>Looking to check two countries off in one European trip?
